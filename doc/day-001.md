# Day 1 - Simple Arithmetic
If you're starting arithmetic from zero, I personally recommend reading [Introduction to Arithmetic on wikibooks](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Arithmetic/Introduction_to_Arithmetic)
## Part 1: Prime Numbers
Prime numbers play a very crucial part of arithmetics and are at the core of number theory.

Every number greater than 1 is either a prime or composite, which means they are either only divisible by 1 and themselves or they can be factorized as a product of primes.

Play around with prime numbers to learn more about them, read more on these helpful links:
