# Day 1 - Simple Arithmetic
If you're starting arithmetic from zero, I personally recommend reading [Introduction to Arithmetic on wikibooks](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Arithmetic/Introduction_to_Arithmetic), although, it is important to note that it is incomplete.

## Extra Details
 - The concept of [Natural Numbers](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Arithmetic/Types_of_Numbers/Natural_Number)
    The natural numbers (i.e. counting numbers) are numbers which are used for counting and ordering. 
    They can be expressed mathematically as: â„• = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, ... }

## Part 1: Prime Numbers
Prime numbers play a very crucial part of arithmetics and are at the core of number theory.

Every number greater than 1 is either a prime or composite, which means they are either only divisible by 1 and themselves or they can be factorized as a product of primes.
The number "1" itself is neither prime nor composite, as it can only be divided by itself.

## Part 2: Even or Odd Numbers
One of the simplest aspects of mathematics, but a very important one.

Play around with even and odd numbers to learn more about them, and read more on these helpful links:
